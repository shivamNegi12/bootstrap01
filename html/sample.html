                                <p>A Cibil Score is a three-digit number that denotes your credit report. The Cibil
                                    score starts
                                    from 300 to 900 and if you are closer to a Cibil score of 900 then it is considered
                                    a good
                                    score. On the other hand, if your score is closer to 300 then it is a bad score and
                                    there
                                    are fewer chances to get any debt. Therefore it is necessary to keep an eye on your
                                    Cibil
                                    Score by checking it regularly. </p>

                                </h3>
                                <p>CIBIL score is a Credit Score generated by a credit rating agency called TransUnion.
                                    TransUnion CIBIL is the gold standard of Credit Scores and the only one that counts
                                    while
                                    seeking finance. While there are several Credit Bureaus that issue credit scores,
                                    CIBIL is
                                    the one that holds most weight with banks. Now, a Credit Score is like your
                                    financial report
                                    card with a numerical representation of your credit health. A CIBIL score can range
                                    from 300
                                    to 900 in India and CIBIL score above 750&nbsp;is considered good for the approval
                                    of
                                    <strong><a href="https://www.wishfin.com/personal-loan"

                                    <strong><a href="https://www.wishfin.com/credit-cards" target="_blank">credit
                                            cards</a></strong>. While evaluating any sort of credit application, the
                                    lender
                                    checks your credit score and your credit history before going ahead with the
                                    application.
                                </p>
                                <p>Therefore you can not point out a better score because every agency has its
                                    parameters to
                                    calculate the credit score and the Cibil TransUnion is one of them. Usually a Cibil
                                    Score of
                                    750 and above is enough to get quick approval for a loan or debt.</p>

                                <p>The short answer is – No if you are the one checking it. But we understand why people
                                    have
                                    this apprehension. So, it is important to understand the nuance.</p>
                                <p>On one side, CIBIL checks are requested by financial organizations to ascertain an
                                    individual’s creditworthiness and on the other, by individuals to monitor their
                                    credit
                                    health. When a person applies to a bank or other lending institutions for a loan or
                                    credit,
                                    the former scenario comes into play. That is, during the evaluation process, a CIBIL
                                    inquiry
                                    is triggered by the bank in the background, which happens without the involvement of
                                    the
                                    applicant. The loan approval decision is partly made based on that score. This is
                                    called a
                                    Hard Inquiry. Now, here’s the thing: every time you apply, the banks run an
                                    involuntary
                                    Credit Check – and that MAY affect your Cibil score adversely giving rise to this
                                    commonly
                                    held fear.</p>

                                    consumption, their CIBIL Score DOES NOT get affected. So our simple advice to users
                                    does not
                                    keep applying for loans and credit cards without accurately knowing their credit
                                    situation.
                                    Because whether you do or not, banks will keep checking your score as often as you
                                    apply,
                                    which reduces your chances for loan approval by reducing your score.</p>
                                <p>You rather check your score on your own first - for free via Wishfin, safely, without
                                    affecting your score. So if your score is low, you see it before the bank does. Say
                                    your
                                    score is lower than 700, then you can improve your score over time by optimizing
                                    your credit
                                    situation and following the score-boosting advice given by Wishfin based on your
                                    score. If

                                    makes a person eligible for better deals on loans and credit cards.</p>
                                <p>But this does not mean that not having a good Cibil score currently makes you
                                    completely
                                    ineligible for all financial products. They may opt for secured loans such as loans
                                    against
                                    property, gold loans, etc by mortgaging their assets. But the options are still
                                    limited.
                                    Some banks and NBFCs may give loans or credit cards even with a CIBIL score of 0,
                                    -1, or a
                                    sub 600 score. But these may be at exorbitant rates of interest, offering very low
                                    credit
                                    limits and stringent repayment terms. The advantage of being on the green side of

                                    is undeniable. Because getting a loan is not enough, getting one on good terms which

                                    viably service is more important. Here are some pros of maintaining a good Cibil

                                <p>This is one of the most commonly asked questions about CIBIL Check – ‘Which factors
                                    affect
                                    your CIBIL Score?’ The answer includes your credit history, payment date, number of
                                    unsecured loans, credit utilization, etc. explained in depth below.</p>
                                <p><strong>Credit History: </strong> It is believed that roughly 30% of your CIBIL score
                                    depends
                                    on your repayment history and timely payment of your dues. Individuals not having
                                    any kind
                                    of credit history will most probably have a zero CIBIL score. But lenders also look
                                    at other
                                    factors such as your annual income and employment stability to estimate your
                                    repayment
                                    capability.</p>
                                <p><strong>Missing of Due Dates: </strong> Your repayment discipline says a lot about
                                    your
                                    credit habits and repayment capacity and is used to gauge your creditworthiness. Any

                                    credit product comes with a designated due date. It is structured using things like

                                    regular credit card bills. Missing due dates even once or twice can affect your
                                    score. If it
                                    happens repeatedly, it will reflect in the credit report generated after every

                                    and will be read as a pattern. This is terrible for your Cibil score and recovering

                                    here becomes hard. So it’s important to cultivate a habit of timely repayment.</p>

                                    Utilization Ratio. Suppose that you have a credit limit of INR 10,000 and you use
                                    only INR
                                    3,000 from it, then your credit utilization ratio is 30%. From this, the lender can
                                    judge
                                    that despite having INR 10,000 available as credit, the borrower needed only 3000,
                                    hence is
                                    solvent and can easily pay back the loan. Borrowers who exhaust their credit limit
                                    frequently are known as Credit Hungry Borrowers, who find it difficult to get any

                                    This is
                                    because lenders can sense desperation. You don’t want to be categorized as ‘Credit
                                    Hungry’
                                    and thereby a high-risk proposition. Every time you apply for a loan or a credit
                                    card, the
                                    bank or lending institution triggers a hard inquiry and the applicant is penalized
                                    in his
                                    score. Most often, this is avoidable and your score unnecessarily suffers. It is
                                    better to
                                    have a Cibil check for free and only apply after you are confident of your score and
                                    apply
                                    for products that you are likely to be eligible for. Also, never apply for credit

                                    again and again, to pay off old credit card debt. Not only will you be facing a debt

                                                will need a minimum Cibil Score of 750 for easy approval. Some lenders
